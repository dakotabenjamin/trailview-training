# Use of the TrailView Rover

## What you need:
- Smartphone with GoPro Mobile App and Mapillary App
- Rover
- Gimbal and GoPro setup
- Spare batteries (gimbal, gopro)
- charger

---

# Setup the rover
1. Double-check all batteries are charged (phone, GoPro, gimbal).
2. Secure GoPro to gimbal and turn the wifi on (hold down button on the side until blue LED blinks).
3. Check gimbal and secure it to the rover. Make sure it is solidly installed/strapped in.
4. Set the rover upright so that it is motionless without needing to be held up, then plug in the gimbal battery. You must not touch the rover while the gimbal is calibrating.

# Connecting to the GoPro

.right[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dakotabenjamin/trailview-training/master/IMG_5421.PNG" height="500" >]
1. Open phone wifi settings and connect to the GoPro. The connection is called cmp-goproX (X being a number 1-4) and the password is the same. 
2. Open the GoPro app, connect to your camera, and tap the settings gear tab (bottom right). 
  1. Make sure "Upside Down" is toggled on.
  2. Scroll to "Delete" and delete all files from the SD card.


---

# Using the Mapillary App 

1. Open the Mapillary app. Go to the camera tab on the bottom.
2. The app will detect the GoPro and give a notification. Select Yes.

# Capturing Photo Sequences
1. Tap the small car icon above the Start button and select walking (Automatic)
2. Tap the (+) icon below the Start button to begin a new sequence. 
3. Once the GPS icon at the top left turns green, you are ready to capture. Press the big green button and start walking.

---

# Operating the Rover Best Practices
- Walk at an even pace along the center of the trail.
- Walk both directions of the trail if you can. Treat each direction as a separate sequence.
- Try not to stop during the sequence. This will add unnecessary photos to that location.
- Check your phone periodically to make sure the camera is still taking photos.
- Keep the horizontal bar on the rover level, even on a hill. You can point it a bit, but too much and the gimbal will over-react. 
- Don’t worry about faces or people in the camera’s view. Mapillary will blur them out. 

---

# Uploading

1. Once you are finished, end the sequence. You will be prompted to upload the photos now, or wait until you have wifi to process them. I recommend processing and uploading via wifi.

# Using the GoPro without Mapillary

Since the mapillary app is seemingly not working right now, we will use a GPS unit and the GoPro's time-lapse function to take photos. 

1. Turn on the camera.
2. Push the wireless connect button on the side of the camera, then use the Mode/Power button to go to the GoPro App option. Push the shutter button to select it. A blue LED will light up.
3. On your phone, go to Settings, then select Wi-Fi. Choose the network named “cmp-gopro#” where # is either 1 or 2. The password will be exactly the same as the network name. 
4. Open the GoPro App and select “Connect & Control.” If this option does not show, then make sure you are connected to the GoPro’s network.

2. Make sure the camera mode is “Photo Time Lapse” using the camera mode icon to the right of the shutter button. 
3. Go into the settings using the wrench icon. Make sure the Field of View is WIDE, the Time-Lapse Rate is 1 second, and the “Upside Down” setting is toggled ON.

---
# Set up the Gimbal

1. Attach the camera to the gimbal and screw it in firmly. 
2. Double check that the gimbal and battery pack are solidly attached to the unicycle mount. 
3. Plug in the battery. Hold the unicycle completely still while the gimbal calibrates itself.

---
# Set up GPS

1. Turn on the GPS unit. 
2. Press Menu twice to get to the main menu
3. Navigate to “Track Manager” using the arrow buttons and press Enter.
4. Press Enter again on “Current Track”
5. Navigate to “Clear Current Track” and press Enter, then select Yes to confirm.
6. Attach the GPS unit to the unicycle or belt loop such that the device antenna points the same direction as the camera. 

---
# Taking Photo Sequences
1. Press the shutter button on the app to begin taking photos. 
2. Walk the center of the path at a constant walking speed. Keep the camera pointed forward. 
3. When finished, press the shutter button again to stop the sequence. 
4. On the GPS unit, navigate to the current track using Steps 2-4 above. Select “Save Track” and enter a useful name. Select Done when finished. You may clear the current track.

# Return the camera and GPS unit to Dakota to process and upload
Writing the GPS info to the camera images takes some Python-fu, so I will take care of that. If you have experience with python, then we can set up a 1-on-1 and I'll show you the steps.
